    description: Accurate perception of the auditory environment relies on the capacity to encode the movement present. Movement is defined as a change in location over time. The resulting property of speed or velocity is derived from a moving stimuli’s duration and displacement; however, it is unclear whether velocity (a specific displacement within a specific duration), displacement, or duration is the key factor in movement threshold. Sensitivity to these motion parameters must be understood in a psychophysically meaningful way in order to manage their covariation in the experimental design and the interpretation of the effective stimulus underlying the perception of auditory motion direction.

    We trained two macaque monkeys to respond to the direction of a simulated motion stimulus presented at various signal-to-noise ratios, velocities, durations, and displacements, and compared the sensitivity to motion direction across conditions. This study represents the first concerted effort to understand the span and limits of non-human primate auditory motion perception to laterally moving noise stimuli. 

  - title: Audiovisual Motion Processing in Humans and Non-Human Primates

    description: • Motion perception is a key aspect of sensory processing that enables animals to interact
with their environment
• While there is extensive research on visual motion psychophysics, little is known about
how auditory and audiovisual motion are perceptually processed
• Non-human primate (NHP) studies in particular offer a unique opportunity to link
perceptual processes to underlying neural mechanisms
• MY GOAL IS to characterize how low-level stimulus features influence perception of
auditory and audiovisual motion in awake, behaving non-human primates
• MY RESEARCH QUESTIONS ARE...
• Under what conditions is perception sensitivity to auditory and visual motion equivalent?
• Characterize audiovisual motion perception and its relationship to auditory and visual
motion perception
